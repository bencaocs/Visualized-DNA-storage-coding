paper for Observable DNA storage coding
In this work, we first use chaos game to filter the candidate set satisfying the constraint, and then use graph search to satisfy the DNA storage code set satisfying the Hamming distance.
chaos game you may use "-length 4 -output codewordstest.fasta -hp 2 -plot 3 -gc 0.5" to run Main.java
but in graphs,you need to Initialize the nodes and edges of the graph to a Graph.Where the vertices do not satisfy the Hamming distance between the edge.
